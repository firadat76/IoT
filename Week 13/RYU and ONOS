# Ryu vs ONOS: Understanding Two Popular SDN Controllers

Both **Ryu** and **ONOS** are open-source SDN controllers that help manage network devices using programmable logic. They differ in design philosophy, use cases, and technical implementation.

---

## What is Ryu?

> **Ryu** is a component-based SDN framework written in Python, designed for developers and researchers who need quick and flexible network application development.

### Key Features of Ryu
-  **Written in Python**: Easy for prototyping and fast development.
-  **Supports OpenFlow 1.0â€“1.5** and other southbound APIs.
-  **Lightweight and modular**: Suitable for small to mid-sized networks.
-  **Developer-Friendly**: Simple to write custom applications with an event-driven model.
-  **Research/Testing Focused**: Widely used in academia.

##  What is ONOS?

> **ONOS** (Open Network Operating System) is a distributed, high-performance SDN controller designed for **carrier-grade** and **large-scale production networks**.

###  Key Features of ONOS
-  **Written in Java**: Optimized for performance and scalability.
-  **Distributed Architecture**: Multiple controllers can run as a cluster for high availability and fault tolerance.
-  **Supports OpenFlow, NETCONF, gNMI**, and other protocols.
-  **Northbound API for custom apps**: REST, CLI, and Java APIs.
-  **Carrier/Enterprise Focus**: Ideal for telecom networks and ISPs.

## When to Use

- Use **Ryu** if you're prototyping SDN apps, learning SDN, or working on small-scale testbeds.
- Use **ONOS** if you're building a scalable, fault-tolerant SDN platform for enterprise or telecom networks.
