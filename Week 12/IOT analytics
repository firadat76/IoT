IoT Data Analytics Using ThingSpeak and MATLAB
  In this activity, you will explore how to analyze real-time IoT sensor data in the cloud using ThingSpeak and MATLAB. Each one of you will work with a simulated or physical IoT device that sends environmental data—such as temperature
  and humidity—to a personal ThingSpeak channel.
  Once data is flowing to their channel, use ThingSpeak’s built-in MATLAB Analytics feature to conduct meaningful analysis. Apply simple techniques such as smoothing noisy data, detecting anomalies, computing averages over time, 
  or exploring relationships between multiple sensor variables. The goal is to uncover patterns, gain insights, and practice making sense of raw sensor readings using cloud-based analytical tools.
  Present their findings in a concise format: a graph produced by the analytics script and a short interpretation of what the data reveals. This exercise encourages thinking critically about data quality, environmental behavior, 
  and the real-world usefulness of IoT analytics.
  This activity strengthens your understanding of the full IoT pipeline—from data generation and transmission to analysis and decision-making—without the need for any local installations or complex software environments.
